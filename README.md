# PInvoke Interop Assistant

This project is a modernization of the [PInvoke Interop Assistant Toolkit](http://clrinterop.codeplex.com/releases/view/14120) which I started almost a decade ago.  The intent is to modernize and refactor the code such that it can be consumed as a library and potentially distributed via new channels.  For example distribute as a modern VSIX or MSBuild plugin.

This is a hobby project and could definitely use a bit of community participation.  Issues will outline the plan for the code going forward.
